DATA WAREHOUSE & ANALYSIS
As a fresh college graduate, I started my IT career as IS Analyst with SQL.  We used Oracle version 9i to manage large amounts of data. This data was later integrated and checked to work with a third party tool that create report and automate them in a proprietary language native to the tool itself.  These reports were later spot checked for accuracy against sql queries.  VBA was also used to create specialized macros that format these reports.
